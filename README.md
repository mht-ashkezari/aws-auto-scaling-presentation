# AWS Auto-Scaling Presentation

This repository contains the presentation slides for my project on **Dynamic Bookings: Auto-Scaling Solutions on AWS**, completed as part of the course **Introduction to Cloud Computing - DV1566** at Blekinge Institute of Technology (BTH).

## Project Overview

The project focused on designing and implementing a scalable and performance-driven booking portal using AWS serverless architecture. Key technologies used include:

- **AWS Lambda** for event-driven backend functions.
- **DynamoDB** for handling dynamic data loads.
- **API Gateway** for routing and integration.
- **AWS Amplify** for continuous deployment and hosting.

## Performance Validation

- The system was stress-tested using Apache JMeter to validate the autoscaling capabilities of the architecture.
- **AWS CloudWatch** and **AWS Amplify**'s built-in monitoring features were used to track system performance under different load conditions.

## Architecture Highlights

- **Scalability**: Seamless, automatic scaling with AWS Lambda and DynamoDB.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Pay-per-use model with serverless execution.
- **Fully Managed**: Minimal operational overhead due to managed services like DynamoDB and Amplify.

## Monitoring Insights

- Detailed metrics collected include requests, bytes uploaded/downloaded, concurrent execution, duration, read/write capacities, and more.
- Graphs showcasing the performance metrics during autoscaling are included in the presentation.

## How to Use

- Download the presentation PDF from this repository: [cloud_presentation.pdf](cloud_presentation.pdf).
